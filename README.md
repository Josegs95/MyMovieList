## About
This is my second portfolio project, and also my final project for my "CFGS" (Advanced Vocational Training).  
The original version was nearly complete but outdated, so I'm rebuilding it from scratch.

The project is called **MyMovieList**. It's based in the famous anime/manga web page [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net). The app 
allows users to create personalized lists of movies and TV shows to keep track of what theyâ€™ve watched or plan to watch.  
It also provides detailed information about each title using data from the TMDB API.
