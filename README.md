<h1>Still in development... (6/04/25)</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
Second portfolio project. This time, it's my final project of my "CFGS" in spanish (I think it's "ASVL" in english). I almost finish it in that time but it's so outdated, so I will create it again from scratch.

The project is called "MyMovieList". It's based in the famous anime/manga web page [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net). The application consists in let their users to
create lists of movies/tv shows to help them organize which one the user want to see in the future, or already saw etc. The application show detailed information of movies/
tv shows obviosly.

In this project I will create a client-server application, use of a DB (MySQL) where save users and all their data. The application uses concurrency, user interfaces and API usage too. For the API, the application will work with JSON files.

<h2>To-Do:</h2>

- Get user's lists from DB and their elements
- Fix comm error cases like mysql service off
- (Optional):
  - Proccess all pages of each API request
  - Add Guest session compatibility for the API: [Link](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/authentication-guest-sessions)
  - Something to view the multimedia's poster bigger
  - Use TSL/SSL
