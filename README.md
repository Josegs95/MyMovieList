<h1>About</h1>
Second portfolio project. This time, it's my final project of my "CFGS" in spanish (I think it's "ASVL" in english). I almost finish it in that time but it's so outdated, so I will create it again from scratch.

The project is called "MyMovieList". It's based in the famous anime/manga web page [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net). The application consists in let their users to
create lists of movies/tv shows to help them organize which one the user want to see in the future, or already saw etc. The application show detailed information of movies/
tv shows obviosly.

In this project I will create a client-server application, use of a DB (MySQL) where save users and all their data. The application uses concurrency, user interfaces and API usage too. For the API, the application will work with JSON files.
